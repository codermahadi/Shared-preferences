# Shared-preferences
 If you don't need to store a lot of data and it doesn't require structure, you should use SharedPreferences. The SharedPreferences APIs allow you to read and write persistent key-value pairs of primitive data types: booleans, floats, ints, longs, and strings.  The key-value pairs are written to XML files that persist across user sessions, even if your app is killed. You can manually specify a name for the file or use per-activity files to save your data.
